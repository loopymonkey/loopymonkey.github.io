## CREATIVE BRIEF 

You Rock The Deuce was an hour long block of music programming on MTV2.  This was a special open for the block that we decided to treat in animated form.  We worked with a french illustrator to create the key frames and backgrounds, and then we worked with World Leaders Entertainment in New York to animate the open.
