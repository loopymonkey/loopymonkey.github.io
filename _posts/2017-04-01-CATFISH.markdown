## CREATIVE BRIEF

For Catfish Season 5 part 2 campaign, we thought it would be fun to do an animated homage to the old Hannah Barbara cartoons of past.  

## STORYBOARD

We eventually mocked up this very rough animatic storyboard to get a feel for how the spot would play out. 

We worked closely with character designer Brian Mainolfi to visualize our main frames and characters to animate with.  We then kept internal using our own animators in house to put together our final cut as well as all audio done with our in house audio team.  The goal was to use animation sparingly in the same simple Hannah Barbara method of less is more in order to execute with a very meager budget and quick timeline.

## EPISODIC USING ADOBE CHARACTER ANIMATOR

For some episodics, we thought it would be fun to try Adobe Character Animator and re-use our favorite catfish villain to talk to the audience directly.
