## CREATIVE BRIEF

Singled Out came back as reboot for the short lived Quibi service.  MTVE produced the show and we were tasked to create the look of the show for Quibi.

The show had a lot of heavy internal elements and we had to work closely with the show team for all deliverables for studio delivery on set.  This required multiple game elements and on set screens as well as helping show team sort out creatively how to relay specific show actions on screens.
