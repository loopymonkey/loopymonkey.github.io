## CREATIVE BRIEF

In 2021 we launched a full rebrand for MTV.  This was a full global rebrand that would effect everything about our brand.  The rebrand won GOLD at Promax 2022 for brand image refresh.

I was responsible to audit all that was needed to get updated for the new look and then make sure all teams had the final files and make sure rollout was seamless across all of our teams.
