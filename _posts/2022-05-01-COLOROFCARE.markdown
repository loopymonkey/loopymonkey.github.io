## CREATIVE BRIEF

The Color of Care was a Smithsonian Channel led project but a multi-platform effort to catalyze a movement to eliminate racial disparities in the delivery of U.S. healthcare. A year-long campaign meant to reach current and future medical professionals as well as impacted communities and policymakers at all government levels to advance solutions toward health equity.

For this campaign we partnered with Gravillis to create the key art which won SILVER at the Promax Awards 2023 for key art.
