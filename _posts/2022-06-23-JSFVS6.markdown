## CREATIVE BRIEF

Jersey Shore Family Vacation - Season 6 saw the return of Sammi "Sweetheart" Giancola.  For this season we decided to focus our attention with her in the key art.

I was tasked to produce the key art for the new season as well as updating our show packaging to include her back into the show open.  

We also worked on a full marketing support campaign with digital, social and linear buys.
