## CREATIVE BRIEF

All Star Shore is an extension to the "SHORE" franchise premiring on Paramount+ and succeeding Jersey Shore.  A competition dating reality where stars from around the world compete in party challenges while living together.

I was tasked to produce the show packaging, key art, promo graphics and all campaign promotion design and motion.
