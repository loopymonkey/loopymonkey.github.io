## CREATIVE BRIEF

The Video Music Awards is a massive tentpole project that requires contstant sync across multiple teams and departments.  This tentpole event is usually visually led out of the gate for promotion since the artists and hosts often come announced very close to the show as deals get negotiated.

We partnered with Studio Dumbar to create the look of the show and then once established worked with an internal team to iterate and create multiple assets across a global delivery channel.
