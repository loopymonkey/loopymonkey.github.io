## CREATIVE BRIEF

Wolf Pack is an American supernatural teen drama television series created by Jeff Davis for Paramount+, based on the 2004 book of the same name written by Edo van Belkom. The series premiered on Paramount+ on January 26, 2023.

I was assigned to produce the key art with the return of Sarah Michelle Geller as well as the promo design and animation.
