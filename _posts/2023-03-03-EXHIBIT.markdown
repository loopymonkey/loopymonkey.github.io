## CREATIVE BRIEF

The Smithsonianâ€™s Hirshhorn Museum partnered with MTV to produce The Exhibit: Finding the Next Great Artist.  This was a docuseries that introduced seven rising American artists selected in consultation with Hirshhorn curators following a national search to become he next great artist.

We were tasked to create key art, show packaging, promo design and motion as well as cross branding across both MTV and The Smithsonian channel.
