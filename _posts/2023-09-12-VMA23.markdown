## CREATIVE BRIEF

The Video Music Awards for 2023 we decided to elevate the established look from last year working again with the same partner Studio Dumbar.  

This was once again a large global tentpole and required close contact with consumer and integrated marketing, events, social, promo, international, and the show team as well as many sub teams waiting for assets to use for supporting ancillary.

Our team working created any and all motion and design assets used to promote the show.

- Key Art
- Promo GFX
- Out of Home print and motion billboards across multiple cities
- Anamorphic video screens
- Ancillary Events supporting
- Event signage
- Digital marketing
