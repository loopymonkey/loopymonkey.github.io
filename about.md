Born and raised in New York, I attended college in Montana then started a career in TV in Seattle before I returned to New York in 1999 and have lived here ever since.  

I originally worked in development during the dot com boom of the late 90's working in flash, php, and to 90s standards what was web development then.  Programming has always been fun and i still continue to program.

I've worked in the televion industry since 1995.  I've worked at CBS, ABC, The History Channel, A&E and MTV.
