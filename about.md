I was born just outside of New York city, and after leaving to Montana for College and a few years of work in Seattle i returned to New York in 1999 and have lived here ever since.  

I worked in development at the dot com boom of the late 90's working in flash, php, and to 90s standards what was web development then.  Programming has always been fun and i still continue to program.

I've worked in the televion industry since 1995.  I've worked at CBS, ABC, The History Channel and MTV.
